                <h2>Everything You Need To Know</h2>
                <p>For early adopters, Sony is throwing in some nice freebies, including a free month of PlayStation Plus, free month of Sony Music Unlimited, and a $10 PlayStation Store credit.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Unfortunately, you can't play PS3 games on the PS4. The same goes for most peripherals. Except for the PS Move, none of your PS3 peripherals (controllers, etc.) are compatible with the PS4. The same goes for older Bluetooth headsets and headphones, at least for now.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The PS4 can play Blu-rays and DVDs, but not CDs or MP3s (for now), and it currently won't read any files from a USB external storage device (via its two USB ports) except system software patches (you have to put the PS4 in a special "safe mode" to do system updates via a USB thumb drive). That's a serious bummer. At launch, it also cannot play 3D Blu-ray movies (nor can the Xbox One). Note that the older PS3 offers support for CDs, MP3s, 3D Blu-ray playback, and reads files from external storage devices.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>If you've already purchased PS3 versions of select titles, you can upgrade to the PS4 version for just $10 more. This only applies to a handful of games.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>To play multiplayer games online, you'll need a PS Plus account ($50 a year), which is a departure from the PS3's free online play model.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>However, unlike the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, you don't need a PS Plus account to use the entertainment apps like Netflix or Spotify.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The PS4 includes a 500GB hard drive, but you can replace/upgrade it yourself -- and it's pretty easy to do.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The PS4 has a "near-perfect" controller (according to our CNET review) that's a big upgrade over the PS3's. It has a built-in speaker and it also doubles as a motion controller (it has a light on the front like the PS Move).
You can charge the PS4's controllers while the console is in standby mode (unlike with the PS3).</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Sony has launched a new PlayStation app for iOS and Android users. It allows you to use your iOS or Android device as a second screen and remote control to display and manage the action from compatible PS4 games, shop at the PlayStation Store, and view PlayStation manuals and system guides.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Unlike the Xbox One, the PS4 doesn't feature any sort of TV overlay functionality -- it's called OneGuide on the Xbox One -- that allows you to switch easily from watching TV to playing games. On the Xbox One, you can also play a game and display live TV in a small panel on the side (Xbox One's "snap" feature lets you run two apps at once, with one of them in a picture-in-picture window). As an integrated home-entertainment device the Xbox One is more sophisticated out of the gate.</p>
