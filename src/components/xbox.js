                <p>The Xbox 360 only had DVD support, and -- briefly, via a peripheral -- HD-DVDs. Blu-ray playback is a pleasant addition. And sorry, lovers of 3D Blu-rays, whoever you are: the Xbox One isn't compatible with you. (There is no 3D Blu-ray compatibility on PS4 at present, either.)</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Xbox Live Gold was pretty much a requirement for any online Xbox gamer before, but that's even more the case now. Any online services require Gold, from streaming Netflix to game DVR functionality (apps and game recordings are free on the PS4, with only online gaming requiring a PlayStation Plus membership).</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The Xbox One comes with a 500GB hard drive, and you're going to have to live with it. Right now, there's no plan to how, exactly, you'll upgrade that storage. The Xbox 360 used to have a proprietary snap-on hard drive; on the One, it lives inside the console. (PS4 owners can self-upgrade with a standard laptop hard drive.)</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Bad news for Xbox 360 owners with huge game libraries: the Xbox One won't play your discs. And any downloaded Xbox games that exist on your Xbox Live account won't transfer over, either. It's a fresh start with the Xbox One, whether you like it or not -- but user settings and account details are retained and carried over.
                  Disc and disc-free games alike need installation on the Xbox One, but if you go the disc route, keep in mind that you'll always need that disc inserted to start the game.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>It's not even close. Not only is the One the bulkier console, but it has a very large power brick adapter attached to the power cable; the PlayStation 4 just has a regular thin plug.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>An HDMI input allows you to run your cable box directly into the Xbox One, feeding it all your TV feeds. The Xbox One has its own searchable menu for TV listings, too, and can change the channel on your cable box, acting on its behalf. But, while you can watch your DVR, you can't use the Xbox One to access your recordings or the menus; for that, you're going to have to use your remote, as usual.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Using Snap, you can create a side split-screen of live TV, NFL scores, or whatever else you can think of while playing a game -- or, combine apps that involve no gaming whatsoever. Some apps don't support Snap yet, but discovering which do takes some trial and error.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The Xbox One encourages you to run your TV and home theater through it, meaning you'll have your Xbox One (and the Kinect) on even when watching old DVR recordings or when watching a movie. You might get pop-up Skype calls, or game notifications, right in the middle of a show. Of course, you can always disconnect it from your TV feed, too.</p>
